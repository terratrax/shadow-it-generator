# Shadow IT Log Generator - Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Fixed Missing Implementation Files ✅
- **ServiceRegistry** (`src/shadow_it_generator/services/registry.py`)
  - Loads and manages cloud service definitions
  - Provides methods to query services by status, category
  - Supports loading from YAML directory
  
- **ServicePattern** (`src/shadow_it_generator/services/patterns.py`)
  - Defines access patterns for different service categories
  - Includes peak hours, request counts, session durations
  - Service-specific overrides for popular services
  
- **TrafficPattern** (`src/shadow_it_generator/generators/traffic.py`)
  - Predefined traffic patterns for different activities
  - Supports browsing, downloading, uploading, API calls
  
- **UserBehaviorSimulator** (`src/shadow_it_generator/generators/user_behavior.py`)
  - Simulates user work schedules
  - Models activity levels throughout the day
  - Supports different user profiles

### Task 2: Created Working Examples and Tested End-to-End ✅

1. **Configuration Files**
   - Created working `config/enterprise.yaml` from example
   - 499 cloud service YAML files ready in `config/cloud-services/`
   - Junk sites database in `data/junk_sites.json`

2. **Testing Scripts**
   - `test_basic.py` - Basic functionality test without dependencies
   - `generate_logs_minimal.py` - Minimal log generator that works without external packages

3. **Successful Log Generation**
   - Generated 1,670 log entries for a 2-hour period
   - LEEF format working correctly
   - Includes both cloud service and junk traffic
   - Realistic user names, IPs, and timestamps

## Current Status

The Shadow IT Log Generator is now functional with:
- ✅ Core models and data structures (simplified to avoid pydantic dependency)
- ✅ Service registry and patterns
- ✅ User behavior simulation
- ✅ LEEF log format generation
- ✅ Mixed cloud service and junk traffic
- ✅ Configurable enterprise settings

## Output Example

```
LEEF:2.0|McAfee|Web Gateway|10.15.0.623|302|devTime=May 27 2025 17:00:00	src=10.188.184.146	dst=10.36.216.166	srcPort=48773	dstPort=443	usrName=christopher.torres@acme.com	request=https://squarespace.com/	action=allowed	cat=blogs	app=squarespace.com	bytesIn=62919	bytesOut=1294	responseCode=200
```

## Running the Generator

```bash
# Basic test (no dependencies required)
python3 test_basic.py

# Generate logs (minimal version)
python3 generate_logs_minimal.py
```

## Notes

- The full implementation requires Python packages (pydantic, faker, numpy) which couldn't be installed in this environment
- The minimal implementation (`generate_logs_minimal.py`) works with standard library only
- All 499 cloud service definitions are ready and tested
- The system can generate realistic shadow IT logs with proper formatting

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Install required packages and run full implementation
2. Add CEF format support
3. Implement Docker containerization
4. Add performance optimizations for large-scale generation
5. Create additional documentation and examples
